# Exploring Terror in Europe (2000 - 2020)

This project examines the evolution of terrorism in Europe over the past two decades, utilizing the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). It tackles three investigative objectives:

## &#127919; Objective-0: 
_"How did the nature, lethality, and modus operandi of terrorist activity evolve across Europe from 2000 to 2020?"_

&#128270; **Focus:** Trends in attack frequency, lethality, tactics, weapons, and targets.

&#128161; *Between 2000 and 2020, terrorism in Europe experienced a **concentrated surge** during 2014 &ndash; 2016, followed by a sharp decline. The `nature` of terrorism evolved from sporadic attacks into **conflict-linked spikes**, especially in Eastern Europe. The `lethality` remained moderate overall, driven by a small number of deadly tactics. The `modus operandi` remained largely unchanged: **bombings and shootings** remained the default tools, while sophisticated or novel tactics remained rare. At the macro level, terrorism in Europe was shaped more by **geopolitical escalation and group reactivation** than by tactical innovation.*

## &#127919; Objective-1:
_"Which perpetrator groups changed their preferred attack types or target profiles over the two decades, and when did those shifts occur?"_

&#128270; **Focus:** Shifts in tactics and target preferences by top terrorist groups.

&#128161; *Among the five groups analyzed, **PKK**, **DPR**, and **LPR** clearly **adapted both their attack methods and target choices** in response to evolving conflict dynamics and strategic goals. In contrast, **ETA and Chechen Rebels** showed **no significant change**, and instead followed static patterns until operational collapse or demobilization.<br>
These findings highlight that **hybrid insurgent actors** (PKK, DPR, LPR) tend to evolve tactically and target-wise over time, especially when involved in prolonged or regionally complex conflicts. In contrast, **ideologically rigid or territorially constrained groups** (ETA, Chechen Rebels) are less likely to adapt.*

## &#127919; Objective-2:
_"What country-to-country 'spill-over' patterns exist?"_

&#128270; **Focus:** Detecting month-level lagged correlations in attack patterns across neighboring countries.

&#128161; *Despite the broad testing across 41 European countries, **no widespread operational spill-over patterns** were found. However, in the case of **Ireland and the United Kingdom**, results show:*
- *Strong correlation of terrorist activity on a **monthly level**.*
- *Aligned activity by **the same groups** or **ideologically similar actors**.*
- *Historical continuity in nationalist extremist movements across borders.*

*This suggests that **terrorism spill-over in Europe is not the norm**, but **can exist under specific geopolitical, historical, and ideological conditions**, particularly in regions with long-standing cross-border disputes and group networks.*
